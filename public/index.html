		<h2>Your tasks</h2>
		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p>Carefully craft a search name that circumvents the internal sql code
		to get the list of all names.</p>
		<p>To do this, have your search name cause sql select statement's WHERE clause to always be true</p>

		<h3>What you should know about the code:</h3>
		<p>Table creation code:</p>
		<pre>'CREATE TABLE people(first_name text, last_name text)'</pre>
		<p>API handler for the person route:</p>
		<pre>
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    const { search } = req.query;
    const db = await getDb();
    try {
        // don't do this, very unsafe
        const spies = await db.all(`select * from people where first_name = "${search}"`);
        res.json({success: true, spies});
    } catch(error) {
        res.json({success: false, error: error.message});
    }
});
        </pre>

		<h3>Other helpful info</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Anything in a line after a "<code>--</code>" is considered a comment</li>
			<li>The syntax for a SELECT statement in sql is:</li>
			<ul><li><pre>SELECT col_name, another_col_name FROM table_name</pre></li></ul>
					<li>SELECTs can have WHERE conditions combined with AND and OR:</li>
					<ul><li><pre>SELECT col_name FROM table_name WHERE col_name > 3 AND col_name < 5</pre></li></ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>To see the answer</h3>
		<p>After you have tried yourself, you can find the answer below in a hidden div. You'll have to view source or use the inspector to see it.</p>
        <div style="display: none">
			Jack" OR TRUE --
        </div>

		<h2>Task 2</h2>
		<p>Carefully craft a search name that circumvents the internal sql code to get the data out of the secret_table.</p>
		<p>To do this, have your search name cause the server to select from the secret_table and add it to your currnet results:</p>

		<p>There may be other ways of messing this up, please restrict yourself to trying to get the info from the secret_table.</p>

		<h3>What you should know about the code:</h3>
